Hello, world!

I'm excited to finally be posting on my blog.

I created this website from scratch with a single css file, no JS, and a static site generator I built in Ruby.

It relies on no third party software that isn't open source, and even then, I'm only using two gems (libraries).

I want this blog to outlive me and not rely on any companies to keep up and running.

What should you expect from this blog? Well, my goal is to rigorously question the world and try to understand it better from first principles. I want to presuppose nothing and explore the why behind things.

My ultimate goal is to figure out what the world needs most and then spend the rest of my life on that thing.

Thanks for reading!
