## About Me

I'm a web developer living in Humboldt County, CA. I spent so much time working on other people's websites that I never thought to make my own. This is my little corner of the internet â€” I hope you like it!

This site was built using a single stylesheet and a static site generator I built with Ruby. I wanted to make a site by myself that doesn't rely on any thrid parties to function.

Ideally, this site will outlast me.
