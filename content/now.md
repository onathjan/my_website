### Last updated on July 2nd, 2024 from my dining room table in Eureka, CA.

## Bootstrapping a one man startup

Right now I am working on a Rails app to help outdoor enthusiasts stay 
safe while out in the field. I will have more to say about this soon.

## Making wild foods more accessible

I am working on a database of wild foods that anyone can use to see 
which wild foods grow near them. I will have more to day about this soon.
