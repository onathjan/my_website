## Playing around with LLMs

I've decided that I want to learn more about LLMs and how they work. Maybe I'll find a use case for them that can be monetized, or maybe I won't. I'm just trying to satisfy my curiosity here more than anything.

## Making wild food more accessible

I'm building a search engine that allows a person to enter a location and a radius and see what wild foods grow around them. Each species will have information about it's edible parts, field guides that cover how to properly ID that species, and other information. 

Foraging is one of my favorite hobbies. It connects you to nature in a very intimate way. It's very relaxing, and something about it just feels right. The more people who source some of their food from wild areas, the more people will care about protecting them.

## Thinking about the future

Watching the field of AI/ML progress so rapidly over the past few years has me worried about the future. I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going to happen, but I think the odds of AI destabilizing the modern way of life in one way or another is fairly high. I've been thinking a lot about what I can do to mitigate some of those destabilizing ripples and adapt quickly to change as the future unfolds.
