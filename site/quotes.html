      <h1>Pocket Quotes</h1>
      <p>I use my phone a lot. I don’t like that I reflexively reach for it whenever I feel an ounce of boredom. I tell myself that I want to live a deep life and think deeply about the world, but then when an opportunity to do so arises, I reach for my phone instead. In other words, my actions are not aligned with my goals and I need to change that if I want to become the best version of myself.</p>
      <p>While looking online for a solution to this problem, I stumbled upon this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKyEDfnDAWM">YouTube video</a> by Parker Settecase. In his video, Parker talks about his book of “Pocket Proverbs” where he keeps quotes that inspire him to think more deeply about the world. Instead of using his phone mindlessly when he gets bored, he pulls out his book of quotes instead and reads through it.</p>
      <p>This sounds like the perfect solution to my problem. I already have a markdown file in my Obsidian vault full of quotes that I’ve come across over the past few years. I never knew what I was going to do with these quotes, but they resonated with me so I wrote them down. Now I’m going to transfer them to a small notebook of my own and see how it goes.</p>
      <p>Below are the quotes that will be going into my pocket quote book. If this sounds like something that might help you avoid using your phone mindlessly, pick some quotes that resonate with you and give making a pocket book of your own a try.</p>
