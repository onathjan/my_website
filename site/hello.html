      <p>Hello, world!</p>
      <p>I’m excited to finally be posting on my blog.</p>
      <p>I created this website from scratch with a single css file, no JS, and a static site generator I built in Ruby.</p>
      <p>It relies on no third party software that isn’t open source, and even then, I’m only using two gems (libraries).</p>
      <p>I want this blog to outlive me and not rely on any companies to keep up and running.</p>
      <p>What should you expect from this blog? Well, my goal is to rigorously question the world and try to understand it better from first principles. I want to presuppose nothing and explore the why behind things.</p>
      <p>My ultimate goal is to figure out what the world needs most and then spend the rest of my life on that thing.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
